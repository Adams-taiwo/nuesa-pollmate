Product Requirements Document (PRD): 
1. Product Objective
# The goal of this project is to develop a secure, efficient, and user-friendly electronic voting (e-voting) platform tailored for school elections. This system aims to:

### Eliminate the inefficiencies and delays of physical voting.
### Significantly reduce the time and labor costs associated with manual ballot counting.
### Increase convenience for students.
### Ensure fast and accurate realtime election results.
### Build a scalable solution that can be reused for future school elections.
